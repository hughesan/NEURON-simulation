# NEURON-simulation

I used the [NEURON simulation environment](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) to test how different Mauthner axon myelination patterns might regulate escape response timing. Attached are .hoc files for each myelin simulation and a .ses session file that supports each simulation.

I created eleven neurons, one Mauthner neuron (named soma[0] in the hoc code) and ten motor neurons (soma[1-10]) which receive input along the length of the Mauthner axon. A real Mauthner axon forms synapses onto far more than ten motor neurons, but this model allowed me to assess how motor neurons located varying distances down the axon might receive input at different time scales. The Mauthner axon’s parameters were selected from biophysical parameters previously reported, including the axon diameter (Buckley et al., 2010), the axon reversal potential, and the capacitance and conductance of myelin membrane (Shen et al., 1999). I distinguished nodes of Ranvier from segments of bare axon by equipping nodes with NEURON’s default excitable channel mechanisms (sodium and potassium channels, Hodgkin-Huxley channels) in addition to passive leak channels, whereas bare axon segments and myelinated axon segments received only passive leak channels. Motor neurons had 10 μm diameter somas and received synapses from the Mauthner axon at NetCon network connections, in which voltage exceeding threshold in the presynapse (the connected region of the axon) would activate an ExpSyn, exponentially decaying synapse, on the postsynaptic motor neuron.


I created three different myelination patterns to add to the Mauthner axon. The first, called “long”, refers to the myelin patterning that is typical in vivo: myelin sheaths on the Mauthner axon are long (90 μm) compared to typical myelin sheaths on other axons (~30 μm) and the Mauthner axon is myelinated along its entire length, with only interruptions for nodes of Ranvier (2 μm length). The second paradigm, “intermediate,” tests what would happen if myelin sheaths were half the length (45 μm) but doubly numerous and still myelinated the entire axon. This “intermediate” phenotype is reminiscent of how several oligodendrocyte manipulations have produced more numerous, but shorter, myelin sheaths (Hughes and Appel, 2019). The third paradigm, “short” has significantly shorter sheaths (30 μm) and incomplete axon coverage (66.7% myelinated), which may be reflective of early Mauthner axon myelination prior to sheath elongation and maturation.


To stimulate the Mauthner neuron, I current clamped the Mauthner soma and delivered 1 nA of current for 5 ms, 10 ms after the onset of recording from the motor neurons. I recorded action potentials from the first and last motor neurons (#1 and #10) and found that they occurred near-coincidently in the model for long- and intermediate-length sheaths, but were visibly offset with short sheaths (see Figure), suggesting a significant delay before the last motor neuron fires. Detecting the time at which the action potential peak voltage occurred for the first and last motor neuron revealed that short sheaths increased this latency 9-fold relative to the other conditions, from 0.05 ms to 0.45 ms. In a larval fish, such a latency between the first and last motor neuron firing may cause rostral muscles to contract and extend before caudal muscles contract, potentially widening the angle of the C-bend. Additionally, whereas latency was unchanged between the long and intermediate sheath conditions, the first motor neuron in the intermediate condition fired 0.1 ms later than the first motor neuron in the long condition, raising the possibility that this shift in myelin patterning would manifest in a slightly delayed, albeit kinematically normal escape response.
